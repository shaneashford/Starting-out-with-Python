# Write a program that converts miles to kilometers. Look up the conversion factor and assign it to a properly named constant (see page 80). The program should permit the user to enter the miles perhaps with decimals, from the keyboard. Print the result showing both distances using an f_string with the kilometers accurate to three decimal places.
# Required Output
# Enter the miles 12.75
# 12.75 miles is 20.519 kilometers
