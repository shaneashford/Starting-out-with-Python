# A taxable item is available in multiple quantities. Write a program that prompts the user for the unit price of the item and the number being purchased. The sales tax rate is 7%. Store that to properly named constant  as a decimal. Calculate and print the subtotal, the sales tax, and the total amount due. Display commas for numbers of 1,000 or more. Note the apostrophe in item's in the Example Output below. Your prompt should do that, too.
