# ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS
# 1. Write a Python program that uses a for loop with the range function to process the integers from 5 to 50 in increments of 5. See page 182 to learn how to do this with the range function. The loop should also print the square and cube of each integer in a table. The integers column should be centered and 7 characters wide, the squares column should be right-aligned and 8 characters wide, and the cubes column should be right-aligned and 12 characters wide. Use an f-string and refer back to pages 70-78 to review formatting. Include column headings with the same alignments and display commas for numbers of 1000 or more. See required output.
