# Write a program that operates like a point of sale terminal for the purchase of three items in various quantities. The program should accept the name, unit price, and quantity of each item as keyboard inputs. Note that the prompts for the price and quantity should display the item name. A line should be printed that reflects these inputs and includes the subtotal for each item. The program should finish by printing the total for the three items.
