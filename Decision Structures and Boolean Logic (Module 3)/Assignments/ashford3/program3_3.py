# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a two-digit integer. If the user's input is acceptable, prompt the user to enter another, DIFFERENT two-digit integer. If this input is also acceptable, the program should determine which integer is larger, and by how much, and print the result (see example outputs). If either input is unacceptable, the program should respond with a statement identifying the bad input. Use nested decision blocks and pay close attention to proper indentation.

# Pseudocode
# Prompt for a 2 digit integer
# Determine if the input is a 2 digit integer or not (> 9 AND < 100)
# If the input is a 2 digit number prompt for a different 2 digit integer
# Otherwise respond with a statement identifying the bad input
# Check if the second integer is a 2 digit integer (> 9 AND < 100) AND != the first integer
# Determine if the first integer is greater than the second integer
# If true determine how much larger (1st inetger - 2nd integer)
# If not determine how much larger the 2nd integer is (2nd integer - 1st integer)
