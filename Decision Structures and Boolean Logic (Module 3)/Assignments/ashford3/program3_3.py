# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a two-digit integer. If the user's input is acceptable, prompt the user to enter another, DIFFERENT two-digit integer. If this input is also acceptable, the program should determine which integer is larger, and by how much, and print the result (see example outputs). If either input is unacceptable, the program should respond with a statement identifying the bad input. Use nested decision blocks and pay close attention to proper indentation.
